# Let's Ponder!

**Desktop-client for community-based Q&A platform geared towards students and learners.**

**Curiosity** is probably one of many motivations in learning. Curiosity could cultivate from stumbling upon something new, being stuck on something, short on references, or many else. This could lead us to wonder on a question, be it asked towards our teachers, professors, or even our friends. Sometimes we get an answer, sometimes we get no answer, or maybe sometimes we got a half-baked answer. Sure sucks.

Based on that, we are building **Let's Ponder**, a platform for curious learner like you. Freely ask, discuss, and answer questions from other Learners. With that, we hope this platform could motivate you to ponder more.
